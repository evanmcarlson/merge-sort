# quasilinear-sorting
This repository contains implementations of merge and quick sort. The program outputs information used to compare runtime efficiencies of the quasilinear sorting algorithms. Insertion sort is included for a quadratic sorting algorithm comparison.

merge sort and quicksort are two sorting algorithms that have a quasilinear--O(n lg n)--running time.
These algorithms are implemented as functions in respective classes and the main class, `TestEfficiency` tests the timing of the implementations against each other. Insertion sort is also used as a comparison.

To get started, download the repository and navigate to the working directory. Open a terminal and enter `javac TestEfficiency.java` to compile and `java TestEfficiency` to run the program.
